Building a better local file search engine.  Repo/Project name subject to change


Plan is to build the Search Engine side to be flexible with searching local sources and be able to output the matched results to comething to consume results - for example a console window / text file.  There are plans to include a way to include a class to output results to a sql database.  Currently it is not functional as I'm still learning about what I need to do for it.
