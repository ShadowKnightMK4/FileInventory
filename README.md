# FileInventory
Building a better local file search engine.  Repo/Project name subject to change


#Design Goal
Plan is to build the Search Engine side to be flexible with searching local sources and be able to output the matched results to comething to consume results - for example a console window / text file.  There are plans to include a way to include a class to output results to a sql database.  Currently it is not functional as I'm still learning about what I need to do for it.


#Current Working Part
The console app by default will print all files
